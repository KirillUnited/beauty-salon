# Professional advice

A professional consultation plays a key role in identifying the causes of aesthetic problems and determining the best methods of correction based on the results of the examination and the individual needs of the patient. Therefore, prior consultation is an essential element to effectively combat existing skin imperfections, wrinkles, as well as fat deposits and unbalanced nutrition.

Importantly, aesthetic health is also linked to lifestyle, including factors such as physical activity and nutrition. In addition, proper nutrition plays an important role in maintaining healthy skin and general well-being. A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals helps maintain skin elasticity and slows down the ageing process.

During the consultation, physical activity regimes and healthy eating recommendations can be discussed with the patient. This integrated approach can improve procedural outcomes and contribute to overall well-being.
