# Carboxytherapy

Non-injection carboxytherapy is a method in which the skin is saturated with carbon dioxide, which leads to stimulation of collagen synthesis and improvement of blood microcirculation. This process helps rejuvenate the skin and eliminate various cosmetic defects.

Despite the relative gentleness of this technique, it provides noticeable results and long-term preservation of the rejuvenation effect. With each subsequent procedure, the skin tightening effect increases, and the ability to combine with other cosmetic procedures, such as chemical peeling or liposuction, makes carboxytherapy for the face and other areas of the body increasingly popular among both women and men.

## What problems does non-invasive carboxytherapy solve?

Carboxytherapy without injections is carried out if there are appropriate indications, which include:

- first signs of aging: the appearance of wrinkles, sagging, pigmentation
- thinning of the skin
- excessive dry skin
- rosacea
- swelling
- acne and post-acne

## Stages of the procedure

- The process begins with skin cleansing, including possible ultrasonic cleaning if necessary.
- Then a special gel conductor is applied to the skin.
- A mask is applied to the patient, which remains on the skin for 25-35 minutes, performing its functions.
- Upon completion of this stage, the remnants of applied products are removed from the skin.
- The next step is massage, which is carried out using appropriate technique and always along massage lines.
- The session ends with closing the pores using a specialized serum.

The entire process takes approximately 50-60 minutes and is comfortable for the patient. After completion of the procedure, slight redness and slight tingling may occur, but these unpleasant sensations usually go away within a few minutes. The absence of the need for a rehabilitation period and the absence of unwanted side effects makes this procedure accessible to patients who have little free time.

## Effect after the procedure

Major changes that last for up to 12 months, provided the patient follows the specialist's recommendations, include:

- Stabilization of the sebaceous glands and narrowing of skin pores.
- Increasing the elasticity and firmness of the surface layers of the skin.
- Achieving a lifting effect for the facial contour.
- Elimination of manifestations of rosacea on the skin.
- Lightening pigmentation and evening out skin tone.
- Visual reduction in the visibility of scars.
- Acceleration of stagnant processes in lymphatic drainage and circulatory systems.
- Reduction of visible signs of cellulite and stretch marks on the skin.

> To obtain the maximum effect, it is recommended to complete a course of 4-7 carboxytherapy procedures at intervals of once every 7-14 days.

- Cardiovascular diseases (for example, angina, thrombophlebitis and others).
- Pathologies of the liver, kidneys and lungs.
