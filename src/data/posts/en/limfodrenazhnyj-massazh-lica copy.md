# Lymphatic drainage facial massage

Lymphatic drainage facial massage is a massage technique that is an integral part of skin care routines aimed at achieving healthy and youthful skin. Based on the principles of activating the lymphatic system, this unique method helps remove toxins, improve blood circulation and improve skin condition.

One of the key elements of lymphatic drainage facial massage is its ability to stimulate the lymphatic system. Lymph is the fluid responsible for removing toxins and waste from the body. Lymphatic drainage massage promotes more efficient lymph outflow, which helps eliminate puffiness, improve microcirculation and speed up the process of skin cell restoration.

In addition, lymphatic drainage facial massage has a relaxing effect, helping to relieve tense muscles and reduce stress. This helps improve overall skin health, reduce tension and fatigue, and create a feeling of comfort and well-being.

**Lymphatic drainage massage initiates a number of processes, such as:**

- improvement of skin tone
- elimination of inflammatory phenomena
- narrowing of pores
- normalization of the sebaceous glands
- stimulation of collagen production
- removal of excess liquid
- giving the skin an inner glow.

Our cosmetologists approach each client individually. Before starting lymphatic drainage massage using specialized products, skin type is diagnosed and tested to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. The face is cleansed of makeup, and then a massage is performed using aromatic oils. At the end of the massage, the skin leaves a feeling of freshness and relaxation.
