# Get rid of expression lines

Mimic (dynamic) wrinkles are formed as a result of contraction of facial expression muscles. Thus, during frowning expression wrinkles appear in the area between the eyebrows, when surprised - on the forehead, and if a person often smiles - around the eyes and mouth. At first, these wrinkles look like thin lines that appear only during active facial expressions and disappear when the facial muscles relax. Over time, expression lines deepen and become furrows and folds that do not disappear even when the facial muscles are relaxed.

The muscular structure of the face is characterised by the Superficial Musculoaponeurotyc System (SMAS). It creates what is known as a three-dimensional network with ties of connective tissue. These tendons are made up of collagen and elastin fibres and are attached to the skin (not the bones!). Therefore, during contraction, the muscles pull the skin (this physiological process we call facial expression), constantly stretching it, which negatively affects its elasticity.

At the same time, the activity of fibroblasts responsible for the production of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid in the dermis decreases. These processes lead to dehydration of the skin and loss of its elastic properties.

## Possible causes of expression lines

1. Active work of mimic muscles. Botulinum toxin injections are indicated for people with active facial expressions.
2. Unbalanced diet, lack of vitamins and minerals in the body.
3. Smoking disrupts the delivery of oxygen to the skin.
4. Disorders of the endocrine and sex glands.
5. Pathology of the gastrointestinal tract.
6. The hereditary causes of expression lines include genetic mutations that are accompanied by impaired collagen and/or elastin synthesis, which leads to decreased skin elasticity and rapid formation of expression lines. In this context, it is reasonable to consider the presence of human pathologies on the side of connective tissue, which have many skin manifestations.
7. Regular overexposure to ultraviolet light. UV rays reduce the skin's regenerative potential. In addition to its oncogenic risk, Uv light contributes to the breakdown of elastin and hardening of collagen fibres, which reduces skin elasticity.
8. Improperly selected cosmetics can cause allergic reactions and reduce the production of hyaluronic acid due to preservatives, fragrances and other ingredients.
9. Alcohol consumption indirectly leads to dehydration of the body, which in turn negatively affects the condition of elastin and collagen fibres of the skin.
10. Stressful situations, lack of sleep, and nervous exhaustion leave their mark on the skin, making it less elastic and increasing the risk of both expression lines and age wrinkles. This is due to the action on the blood vessels of adrenaline, a stress hormone, one of whose functions is to spasm peripheral blood vessels. Thus, when a stressful situation occurs, adrenaline is released into the bloodstream, which, by reducing the diameter of capillaries and small vessels, disrupts the blood supply to the skin.
11. With reduced vision, a person may squint their eyes to get a clearer image, which also causes expression lines around the eyes and on the bridge of the nose.

## Diagnostics and examinations

The following parameters are taken into account when selecting the correction tactics:

- level of gravitational ptosis - the degree of "sagging" of the facial skin, which depends, among other things, on the expression of subcutaneous fatty tissue;

- the amount of hyaluronic acid, the production of which decreases with age, reducing the skin's moisture content;

- the degree and type of facial muscle tone disturbance.
