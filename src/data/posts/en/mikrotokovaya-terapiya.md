# Microcurrent therapy

Microcurrent therapy is an effective method that uses modulated pulsed currents of low intensity and voltage with specific frequency characteristics to achieve cosmetic or therapeutic results.

In the field of aesthetic cosmetology, this procedure is most often used for the purpose of tissue restoration and rejuvenation. It is highly effective, painless, does not require a recovery period and has a complex effect. Thanks to all these benefits, microcurrent therapy is a popular method independent of climatic conditions.

> Microcurrents for the face help maintain muscle tone, eliminate swelling, and help normalize metabolic and enzymatic processes of the skin.

**Microcurrent procedure is recommended for the following cases:**

- The appearance of wrinkles and folds on the skin.
- Signs of skin aging.
- development of a double chin.
- Dysfunction of the sebaceous glands.
- Problems with acne and post-acne.
- Hyperpigmentation.
- Ptosis (tissue drooping).
- Scars and stretch marks on the skin.
- Manifestations of cellulite.
- Swelling in the upper and lower eyelids.
- Pronounced bags and bruises under the eyes.
- The need for recovery after surgery.

## The essence of the procedure

Microcurrent therapy, also known as biostimulation, uses low-frequency electrical currents to effectively stimulate cell activity. These electric currents are low-intensity and they are safe for the skin, which is why microcurrents on the face are one of the safest cosmetic procedures.

Microcurrent facial therapy is effectively used to combat the signs of skin aging. It improves blood circulation and facilitates the distribution of nutrients in the skin. The skin quickly recovers due to the activation of the production of lipids, proteins and enzymes necessary for the normal functioning of cells.

Microcurrent therapy achieves a lifting effect that helps restore facial contours. This procedure also affects the muscles, helping to normalize them and smooth out wrinkles.

**The course of microcurrent therapy includes 10-15 sessions with an interval of 3-4 days. Results are usually visible almost immediately and include:**

- facelift
- smoothing out small wrinkles
- improvement of skin color and texture
- elimination of swelling.

The effect lasts for at least six months after completion of the course. To maintain results, it is recommended to use high-quality skin care products and periodically visit a cosmetologist every 2-3 months.
