# Get rid of excessive sweating:

Sweating is a natural physiological process necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Increased sweating, although not life threatening, often causes discomfort such as odour, itching, wet palms and marks on clothes, which can lead to insecurity, frustration and complexes.

Self-treatment in this case is not recommended, because to get rid of hyperhidrosis completely, it is often necessary to eliminate its underlying cause. Only a qualified cosmetologist can effectively solve this problem or refer to a specialised specialist, if excessive sweating is a consequence of a serious pathology.

Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating focusing on the armpits, palms, feet and groin, and less commonly the face, chest and back. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs for no apparent reason and is most often due to heredity or stress. Secondary hyperhidrosis is a symptom of diseases such as diabetes mellitus, kidney pathologies, infections, oncology, etc.

One of the most effective techniques to get rid of sweating is injectable procedures. Treatment of sweating with injections (Botox and Dysport)

The main active ingredient, botulinum toxin blocks the signals travelling from nerve endings to the sweat glands, preventing the "command" to produce sweat. Injections of the drug are administered in small doses and, regardless of the cause of excessive sweating, can get rid of hyperhidrosis in a single session. The procedure is safe, does not affect the overall process of water and heat exchange of the skin, and does not require long rehabilitation. The results obtained are maintained for 4-6 months, depending on the metabolic rate, after which it is recommended to repeat the procedure.
