# Laser hair removal

Laser hair removal is a gentle method of dealing with unwanted hair on any part of the body. It works by targeting melanin without damaging the skin. The laser beam reaches a predetermined depth, damaging the hair follicles, which results in stopping hair growth.

Among the main advantages of laser hair removal in should be highlighted:

1. There is no sensation of noticeable discomfort or pain.
2. Complete safety and no possibility of infection
3. Efficiency and speed of processing this area
4. Significant achievement of results
5. Irreversibility of permanent hair destruction"
6. No undesirable effects such as inflammation, burns and scarring
7. Can be used on hair that has ingrown hairs

## How the procedure is carried out

Laser hair removal is performed on hair that is in the active growth phase, on pre-shaved skin. First, the work area is cleaned, then a contact gel is applied. This gel improves the glide of the manipulator over the working area and acts as a conductor for the cooling element to minimize discomfort during the procedure.

> With our laser we achieve excellent results, even in situations where other hair removal methods are completely ineffective. The use of narrowly focused laser beams can eliminate problems with ingrown hairs, irritation, folliculitis and subsequent pigmentation.

During a course of laser hair removal it is important to avoid the following activities: pulling hairs with tweezers, using home electric epilators, shugaring or waxing, as this can reduce the effectiveness of the procedures. This is because the hair is a conductor for the laser treatment to the follicle.

It is important to note that laser hair removal does not damage the surrounding tissue and does not damage the integrity of the skin, provided that the specialist's recommendations after the procedure are followed. It is important to avoid tanning, using care products containing alcohol, and steaming the treated area.

## How many treatments are required

The power characteristics of the device allow you to achieve the desired result in just 3-4 sessions, carried out at intervals calculated individually in 3-5 weeks. The need for multiple repetitions of the procedure is due to the fact that some hair follicles are periodically in a phase of "sleep" and can not be treated. The duration of the course of treatment to eliminate unwanted hair, the number of sessions and the final result are closely related to the individual characteristics of the patient, his hormonal background, the speed of maturation of follicles, skin type and the original colour of hairs.
