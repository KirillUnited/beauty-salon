# Body Mesotherapy

Body mesotherapy is a method that involves introducing pharmacological drugs into the deep layers of the skin in order to stimulate receptors and improve microcirculation of lymph and blood. We actively use this procedure to combat cellulite, excess weight, as well as to eliminate sagging and cosmetic skin defects, such as stitches, scars and rosacea. Body mesotherapy is used in a variety of areas including the neck, shoulders, inner arms, abdomen and thighs.

The most popular among these procedures is abdominal mesotherapy, since it is in this area that the largest accumulation of fat deposits is usually observed. The appearance of sagging and stretch marks after childbirth, as well as a decrease in skin firmness and elasticity.

## What are lipolytics for the body and what is the mechanism of their action?

One of the most effective methods of figure correction, known as injection lipolysis. It is based on the introduction of specially developed drugs called lipolytics, which have the ability to destroy fat deposits and restore metabolic processes in fat cells by improving lymphatic drainage and stimulating the synthesis of elastin and collagen fibers.

**Under the influence of lipolytics, the following changes occur in the body:**

- The breakdown of fat into its component parts occurs due to an increase in osmotic pressure, which ultimately leads to the destruction of the fat cell membrane.
- The breakdown products of fat cells enter the blood and lymph and are then eliminated from the body through the work of the kidneys and liver.
- The procedure also promotes the formation of flat-bone scars in the injection areas, which actively promotes the destruction of adipose tissue.

**As a result of using lipolytics for figure correction, the following effects can be achieved:**

- Skin tightening.
- Elimination of cholesterol plaques in blood vessels.
- Extraction of fat deposits.
- Elimination of localized fat and cellulite of varying severity.
- Reducing excess weight.
