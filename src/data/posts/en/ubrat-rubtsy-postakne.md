# Eliminates acne

Getting rid of acne scarring is a complex process. These scars result from prolonged inflammation, and skin that is susceptible to trauma and infection is a frequent victim of them.

Postacne manifests itself in the form of spots, persistent redness and scars, which are a consequence of complex acne, improper care of problem skin, self-extrusion of pimples and the use of inadequate care products.

Scar removal is done after thoroughly eliminating their cause - complete overcoming of acne, as otherwise new acne marks are inevitable.

Forms of post-acne marks include scarring, red patches, and hyperpigmentation. Scars are caused by aggressive breakout of the skin by blackheads, red spots are due to excess melanin, and hyperpigmentation is patches of different colours left behind by acne.

Modern methods of getting rid of post-acne include laser scar removal, which is performed using special laser settings to precisely destroy scar tissue and stimulate the production of collagen and elastin.
