# IPL photorejuvenation

Using a modern device for photorejuvenation IPL allows you to carry out a full rejuvenation of the skin, eliminate defects and signs of aging. This procedure is completely safe and does not come with any unwanted side effects

> In addition to the process of natural skin aging, there is also the concept of photoaging

_**What is photoaging of the skin?**_

It is a natural process that causes structural changes in the skin due to regular and excessive exposure to direct sunlight, independent of internal organismic processes. This is a violation of the process of renewal of the upper layer of the skin, which is manifested in dryness, loss of elasticity and tone, formation of wrinkles and age spots

## Indications of IPL photorejuvenation

**Pigment spots and freckles:** The heat treatment process breaks down melanin, making age spots darker. Later, the top layer of skin is exfoliated and a new, healthier-looking layer of skin takes its place.

**Vascular defects (such as couperosis, vascular stars and rosacea):** Due to the combined energy of light and heat in the upper layers of the skin, oxyhaemoglobin (the natural red pigment of the blood) absorbs impulses, which is transformed into heat energy and transferred to the walls of dilated blood vessels. This causes the vessel walls to stick together and over time the vessel atrophies.

\*\* Acne and post-acne:\*\* Light pulses destroy the blood vessels that feed inflamed sebaceous glands. Optimal heat exposure helps to initiate the skin's regeneration processes.

\*\* Wrinkles:\*\* The use of IPL therapy stimulates the skin's own production of collagen and elastin, which helps to correct age-related skin changes. Several sessions of photorejuvenation are required to achieve the best results.

**Scars, scars and stretch marks:** IPL pulses improve skin condition, making it smoother, firmer, less porous. Phototherapy can be combined with other cosmetic procedures such as mesotherapy, laser skin resurfacing, chemical peels and others.

## Sequence of procedure execution

Depending on the specific problem and the desired result, an individual programme is selected.

**The IPL procedure involves several steps:**

1. Application of contact gel to the treatment area.
2. Application of light pulses to problem areas of the skin.

A series of short bursts of light causes the protein to clot and destroy damaged cells (e. g. those with excess pigment). These cells are naturally removed from the body and in their place, the process of rebuilding new and healthy skin cells begins.

After the treatment, collagen and elastin production is activated, which helps to renew the top layer of the skin. The duration of Ipl therapy depends on the number and size of the areas to be treated. There may be slight redness after the procedure, which usually disappears within a few hours.

In order to maintain the achieved result and increase the duration of its preservation after the procedure, it is recommended to avoid sunbathing and visiting a bath or sauna for 14 days.

In some cases, to achieve the best effect and complete elimination of wrinkles formed, it may require 3-7 treatments at intervals of 21-28 days. This promotes active synthesis of collagen and elastin, which in turn promotes rapid skin tightening and collagen support formation.

> IPL photorejuvenation treatment is recommended not only to improve the skin of the face and neck, but also for other areas of the body where signs of photo-aging are visible, such as the d√©colletage area, arms, back, etc.

## Benefits of skin photorejuvenation

The benefits of phototherapy include:

- Highly effective because it stimulates the body's own synthesis of collagen and elastin.
- Painless and no discomfort during the procedure.
- Impact on multiple problems at the same time.
- Atraumatic and the ability to maintain a routine lifestyle without special restrictions.

All these characteristics make phototherapy an ideal choice for active women and men who have limited time to visit a beautician. No recovery period is required and you can continue to use your decorative cosmetics without interrupting your routine, while your skin is rejuvenated and healthier.

## Contraindications of photorejuvenation

IPL treatment is not recommended for the following direct contraindications:

- Pregnancy and lactation period.
- Cancer.
- Skin pathologies such as dermatitis, psoriasis and others.
- Blood clotting problems.
- Use of medications such as antibiotics, aspirin and others.
- Diabetes mellitus.

A relative contraindication is a fresh tan on the skin area to be treated. In this case, it is recommended to postpone the procedure for 21-28 days to avoid possible side effects in the form of microburns.
