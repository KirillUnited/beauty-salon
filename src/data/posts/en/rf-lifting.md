# RF lifting

As skin ages, various changes occur, and the extent of these changes varies from person to person. During the aging process, the level of collagen fibers in the body decreases, which affects the quality of the skin. It becomes less elastic, loses its natural tone and wrinkles appear.

Modern aesthetic cosmetology offers many methods to counteract the signs of aging. Some of them can be compared in effectiveness to surgical interventions.

This method is based on the use of radio frequency radiation, which heats the deep layers of the skin. This allows for significant improvements in skin quality, eliminating the need for surgical procedures, and without causing discomfort or damage to the upper skin.

> Facial thermolifting is a safe procedure in cosmetology that helps fight wrinkles, skin aging and signs of aging on the face in a short time. This procedure is completely painless and does not require surgery, ideal for the delicate area around the eyes and lips.

During the procedure, radiofrequency exposure raises the temperature in the deep layers of the dermis, which helps stimulate the synthesis of elastin and collagen, as well as improve metabolic processes. This natural process supports cell regeneration, giving the skin instant lifting and rejuvenation. The price of a thermolifting procedure depends on the area being treated.

## Indications for RF lifting

1. Deep wrinkles
2. Loose skin, decreased tone
3. Excessive accumulation of fatty tissue
4. Withering and sagging skin

## How it works?

The device applies high frequency current, penetrating deep into the epidermis to stimulate collagen production. Collagen is a protein substance responsible for the firmness, elasticity and hydration of the skin. The device accurately doses heat, affecting exclusively the deep layers of the skin, in particular the dermis. This heat activates fibroblasts and strengthens connective fibers. The procedure is pleasantly warm, and the first results are visible after the first session.

The device has several modes and control systems, ensuring safety during execution. Each pulse is customized based on the target and treatment area.

## Advantages of RF rejuvenation technique

Radio wave facelift is a method that promises reliable and noticeable results that are already noticeable after the first procedure and can last from 3 to 5 years after completion of the full course. The advantages of this method include:

- The procedure is comfortable and effective.
- Does not leave marks or damage on the skin.
- Can be performed at any time of the year.
- The effect becomes more noticeable over time.
- The procedure is safe and does not cause side effects.
- Does not require a recovery period.
- Can be successfully combined with other cosmetic procedures.

## How the procedure is carried out

The essence of the method is a targeted effect on particularly vulnerable areas of the skin, where wrinkles most often appear and natural loss of tone is manifested (these areas include the skin around the eyes, lips, forehead, cheeks, nasolabial folds, neck and chin).

Radiofrequency facial lifting does not require special preliminary preparation or anesthesia, and does not require a recovery period, which makes it accessible even during your lunch break. It is not recommended to apply makeup before the procedure begins, and men should shave if the area around the eyes is to be treated, and contact lenses should not be worn.

The patient is placed in a comfortable position on the treatment couch, and if necessary, the hair is protected with a cap. The process is divided into several stages:

- Carrying out a light peeling to prepare the skin.
- Application of a special conductive gel that does not cause allergic reactions.
- Selection of the required exposure mode.
- The doctor performs a targeted effect in certain areas of the face.
- As the manipulation progresses, rare and minor tingling sensations may occur that do not cause discomfort. The procedure lasts 15-20 minutes and a nourishing mask may be applied at the end to soothe the skin and consolidate the results.

It is important to note that the treatment regimen is selected individually for each patient, depending on his skin type, the desired result and the area that needs to be treated.

## Effectiveness of thermolifting face

Radiofrequency facial lifting has a long-term effect, and the result becomes visible immediately after the first procedure. It is recommended to take a course of 6 sessions, with an interval of 10 days between them, to achieve lasting results. Repeating the procedure is recommended 1-2 times a year.

Under the influence of radio frequency current, the skin acquires a denser, more elastic and elastic structure. After the wrinkle lifting procedure, facial contours become more expressive and eyebrows are raised. Radiofrequency lifting also helps reduce scars and smoothes out text enhances the skin and evens out the tone of the face. After the first session, circles under the eyes become less noticeable, and the skin takes on a youthful and healthy appearance.
