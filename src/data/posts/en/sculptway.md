## What is SculptWay?

All body contouring devices mainly work to reduce fat or tighten the skin. However, if you are slightly overweight and want to achieve a slimmer look, or want your stomach or butt to be better shaped and look more toned, then strengthening your base should be the first step. Since our body is made up primarily of muscle at a ratio of 3 to 1, strengthening and developing muscles plays a key role in achieving the desired shape. SculptWay was designed with this goal in mind and allows you to burn fat and strengthen muscle at the same time. This innovative device is also the world's first non-surgical method for butt lift. With SculptWay you can train your abdominal muscles, shape your buttocks and create a toned figure.

### What exactly does SculptWay do?

SculptWay begins by building and strengthening the muscle base underneath the fat layer. Then, by increasing muscle density, it helps reduce belly fat. This helps to create a slimmer and more athletic body shape. When applied to the buttock area, SculptWay strengthens all muscles, giving the buttocks a more toned and athletic appearance. As muscle density increases, body shaping occurs.
