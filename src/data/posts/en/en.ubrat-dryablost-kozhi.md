# How to eliminate skin laxity

Loss of skin tone and firmness is the result of the body's natural ageing processes, accompanied by a decrease in collagen content and slower cell renewal. To these factors are added external influences such as unfavourable ecology, irrational nutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiency, everyday stressful situations and others.

It is impossible to completely prevent the loss of elasticity and avoid the appearance of loose skin, but you can significantly slow down this process with the help of proper care and professional cosmetological procedures.

Signs of loss of skin elasticity include the following visual manifestations:

- the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles;
- increase in pore size;
- the formation of age spots;
- loss of healthy skin tone;
- slow recovery and return of the skin to its original shape (appearance of sagging after weight loss).
