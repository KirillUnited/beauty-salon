# Laser facial rejuvenation

Young skin is characterized by the absence of wrinkles, pigmented appearance, and also has small pores and smooth texture. However, achieving this type of result long-term with peels and Botox injections alone can be difficult. Laser facial rejuvenation is one of the most advanced and effective methods that provides lasting and quick results.

## The effectiveness of laser facial rejuvenation techniques

The main advantage of laser skin rejuvenation is that it provides impressive results without the need for surgery, which cannot be said about even the most effective cosmetic products. Creams, balms, gels and serums act superficially on the skin, while laser techniques target deeper layers and even the subcutaneous substance.

The essence of this procedure is a controlled thermal effect on individual areas of the skin. As a result, different layers of the skin are heated using pulses, which stimulates the natural process of collagen and elastin synthesis. This leads to a sustainable improvement in microcirculation and the elimination of the main signs of skin aging, such as age spots and small capillaries.

Although laser rejuvenation procedures vary, their general principle is based on the use of low-level laser radiation. The depth of laser exposure is selected depending on the skin type, its condition and the nature of the problem. As a result of thermal exposure, the surface layers of the skin are gradually destroyed, and cells begin to renew. The complete skin regeneration process takes from two weeks to a month.

## Main indications for laser skin rejuvenation

1. The first signs of natural aging: facial and age wrinkles;

2. Age spots;

3. Scars, acne scars;

4. Vascular pathologies: asterisks, rosacea;

5. Enlarged pores;

6. Flabbiness of the skin, sagging tissues;

7. Acne, acne and post-acne;

This procedure also helps restore skin elasticity and tone and improves complexion. It is suitable for all age groups and successfully solves the most complex skin problems, including wrinkles, loss of elasticity, as well as various aesthetic and medical defects, such as dilated blood vessels on the face and body, rosacea, telangiectasia and hyperpigmentation. The procedure is safe, does not cause side effects, is completely painless and does not require recovery time

## How the procedure is carried out

The rejuvenation procedure brings only a pleasant feeling of warmth and does not cause any burning or discomfort. Thanks to short pulses, the skin gradually warms up, which promotes the expansion of blood vessels that nourish the base layers of the skin. This stimulates collagen synthesis and improves metabolism. After the procedure, slight redness may occur, which will disappear within a few hours.

The duration of the procedure depends on the area of ​​treatment, goals and scope of work. Usually, on average, the whole process takes 30-40 minutes.

During this time, a full cycle of the procedure is performed, which includes:

1. Removing makeup and completely cleansing the face.

2. Therapeutic effect on the skin.

3. Application of anti-inflammatory and regenerating agents after completion of the procedure.

## What results can I expect from laser rejuvenation?

The first positive results can be noticed after just one session, but it is recommended to complete the full course, which usually includes 4-6 procedures. The lifting effect increases over 6 months, which significantly improves the condition of the skin. This result is achieved by stimulating the skin’s own production of collagen and elastin after the procedure. The repetition frequency of sessions is usually once a month.

Laser exposure destroys old collagen structures, promoting the formation of new ones. This process of skin renewal leads to firming, tightening and smoothing of the skin.

## Recommendations after the procedure and contraindications

After the procedure, visible results appear immediately, however, in order to make the effect more lasting, it is recommended to complete the full course, usually including 4-6 sessions.

- Protect skin from direct sunlight.

- Use moisturizing creams.

The laser rejuvenation procedure is contraindicated in the following cases: in the presence of inflammatory processes on the skin, manifestations of herpes, during pregnancy and lactation, with exacerbation of chronic diseases, as well as in the presence of cancer.
