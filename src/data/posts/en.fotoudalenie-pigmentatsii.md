# The most effective methods to remove age spots

The use of phototherapy for pigmentation removal is a technique in which age spots are eliminated using intense broadband pulsed light with a predetermined depth of penetration in wavelengths to areas of skin with uneven distribution of melanin.

We offer a unique and effective method of pigmentation removal based on selective photothermolysis (IPL).

This method provides complete and long-term removal of the pigmented layer of skin, instead of temporarily masking the problem. Non-invasive pigmentation treatment using this method eliminates intense painful sensations, does not cause burns or pigmentation disturbance, while achieving significant results in the shortest possible time. After the procedure, there may be slight redness of the skin, which goes away on its own and does not require additional intervention.

For complete removal of pigment spots on the face is recommended to undergo a course of 3-5 procedures, the number of which is determined by a cosmetologist, taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient, the type of skin and the nature of the lesion.

A course of phototherapy procedures not only allows you to get rid of age spots, but also significantly rejuvenates and improves the condition of the skin. The benefits of photo pigmentation removal results include:

- Complete removal of pigment spots with dramatic results in the shortest possible time.
- Smoothing and giving a healthy skin tone with overall skin rejuvenation.
- Addressing signs of skin ageing, including the smoothing of fine lines, wrinkles and micropigmentation.
- No discomfort, pain or unwanted side effects

## Laser pigmentation retraction

Laser pigmentation removal is a process in which cells with increased pigment (melanin) are removed at the cellular level using targeted laser beams. This method provides precise treatment of pigmented areas while leaving the surrounding healthy tissue intact, minimising the risk of infection, burns and possible side effects.

Immediately after laser removal of pigment spots is observed darkening of the treated areas, which in the next few days begin to peel and become noticeably lighter. With the passage of time, there is a final disappearance of pigmentation.

The procedure of laser removal of pigment spots is carried out as part of the course, the number of sessions which depends on the individual characteristics of pigmentation, the depth of its occurrence and intensity of manifestation. This approach maximises efficacy and achieves optimal results with minimal impact on surrounding tissues.

## Peeling for age spots

Peeling for pigment spots is an effective and gentle method aimed at correcting this skin defect. Depending on the level of skin that is treated, the following types of peeling are distinguished:

- **Superficial peeling:** Lactic, glycolic, almond and other acids of low concentration are used, affecting the upper layer of horny scales. There is no recovery process and the redness that occurs after the procedure naturally disappears within a few hours.

- \*\*Mid peels:\*\*The peel is performed using acids at a concentration of 20-30%, affects the epidermis and is more effective than a superficial peel, often being able to remove pigmentation after just one session.

- **Deep peels:** In this case phenol is used, the procedure involves the dermis and is a full-blown operation requiring the involvement of an anaesthetist. The final results of pigmentation elimination appear after six months. In addition, there is a pronounced anti-ageing effect on the facial skin.

## Mesotherapy with bleaching cocktails

Effective and safe levelling of facial skin tone is achieved using innovative mesococktails based on highly active brightening ingredients. These components interact with each other to provide an enhanced effect due to their optimal concentration. Mesotherapy for pigmentation correction often includes cocktails with glutathione, vitamin C, azelaic and glycolic acids, bearberry and liquorice extracts, alpha-arbutin and other active ingredients.

After the injection of mesococktails, the vessels are strengthened, the skin is repaired, renewed and rejuvenated, and age spots are lightened. To achieve optimal results, it is recommended to undergo a course of 6-8 treatments at intervals of once every 5-7 days.
