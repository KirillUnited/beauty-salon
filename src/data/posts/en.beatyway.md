# BeatyWay Complex

This method is a combination of rejuvenating treatments and dermatological care for the skin, achieving guaranteed results similar to a comprehensive medical treatment.

The device is equipped with unique programmes for different skin types and purposes, including sensitive skin with couperosis and rosacea, acne and post-acne, lifting and wrinkle correction, recovery and rehabilitation, eye care, and lymphatic drainage to relieve puffiness and pastosity.

## The BeatyWay process involves several steps:

1. Microneedling: is a procedure in which the skin is pierced with fine needles to stimulate healing and regeneration. This treatment is painless and effective, suitable even for thin and sensitive skin.

2. Microcurrents: this is a treatment of the skin with electric current of small parameters, ideal for moisturising, reducing wrinkles, fighting acne and pigmentation, as well as for lifting.

3. LED lamp: it is a method of skin rejuvenation using light energy without heat. This method is effective against hyperpigmentation and skin conditions such as rosacea, dermatitis and eczema.

The first results are visible after 1-2 treatments, and the full therapeutic course includes 10-15 sessions.

**This comprehensive method gives the skin:**

- deep moisturisation
