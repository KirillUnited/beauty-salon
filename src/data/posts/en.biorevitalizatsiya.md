title: Biorevitalisation
description: Biorevitalisation is a skin rejuvenation method that uses injections of hyaluronic acid based products under the skin or into the upper layers of the skin. These drugs stimulate and activate the synthesis of elastin and collagen fibres, resulting in skin cells regenerating from the inside out. The treatment also helps to restore skin moisture levels, reduce fine lines and even out skin texture. In addition to hyaluronic acid, preparations for biorevitalisation contain vitamins, trace elements and plant extracts, which work together to enhance the positive effects of the main component.

# Biorevitalisation

Biorevitalisation is a skin rejuvenation method that uses injections of hyaluronic acid based products under the skin or into the upper layers of the skin. These drugs stimulate and activate the synthesis of elastin and collagen fibres, resulting in skin cells regenerating from the inside out. The treatment also helps to restore skin moisture levels, reduce fine lines and even out skin texture. In addition to hyaluronic acid, preparations for biorevitalisation contain vitamins, trace elements and plant extracts, which work together to enhance the positive effects of the main component.

## Biorevitalisation of the skin with hyaluronic acid

The main and unique benefit of hyaluronic acid is its ability to hold water molecules in a bound state, which allows water to stay in the body without causing oedema. This process improves skin texture and colour, hydrates the upper layers of the dermis and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.

**The facial biorevitalisation procedure includes several stages:**

- Cleaning and disinfecting the area where the procedure will be performed.
- Local anaesthesia, which can be achieved using an anaesthetic gel or spray.
- Determining injection technique and points to be injected.
- Administration of shallow subcutaneous injections at a minimal angle until papules 1-2 mm in diameter are formed.

Hyaluronic acid injections are performed along the massage lines with at least 1 cm between them. In the case of neck injections, arc-shaped lines at 1.5 cm intervals are used. The décolletage area is treated along V-shaped lines with a distance of 2 cm.

The duration of the procedure depends on the size of the area to be treated and can range from 5 to 30 minutes. Hyaluronic acid injections can be performed in various problem areas such as the face, neck, décolletage area and others. To achieve the best effect, a course of 3-4 treatments with an interval of 14 days is recommended. To maintain the results obtained, it is recommended to repeat the facial biorevitalisation procedure every 6-7 months.

## Indications for the procedure

**The main indications for biorevitalisation include:**

- Loss of skin elasticity.
- Dryness and lack of moisturisation of the skin.
- The appearance of surface wrinkles.
- Enlargement of pores on the skin.
- Increased sebaceous gland activity.
- The need to restore the skin after other cosmetological procedures, such as peels, resurfacing, surgical interventions and others.

> The effect after a course of hyaluronic acid injections lasts for 6-12 months and directly depends on the patient's lifestyle.

## Results from biorevitalisation

The time when results occur after biorevitalisation depends on the patient's initial skin condition. However, after just the first session, you can feel your skin take on a healthy glow and the texture becomes more even. To achieve the best possible results, most often the doctor recommends a course of treatments, the number and intervals between which depend on the patient's initial problems. For example, it may take up to 8 treatments, spaced 1-2 weeks apart, to soften hyperpigmentation after a period at the beach.

**There are a number of contraindications to biorevitalisation:**

- Pregnancy and breastfeeding period.
- Individual intolerance to the drug components.
- Presence of inflammatory foci in the area to be treated.
- Herpes exacerbation.
- Acute infections such as acute respiratory infections and others.
- Autoimmune diseases and cancer.
- Blood clotting problems.
- Increased tendency to keloid scar formation.
